## TODOs

* game crashes after a while (memory leak?)
* world generation
* enable player to move the character around
* NPCs and very simple AI
* build simple rasterizer, rendering with camera view, finding the screen position of pixels from a 3d world-coordinate system.
* add texture support for rasterizer
* asset management for textures
* fix sound overall (HARD, STUCK, HELP)
  
## Optimizations
* better memory usage. maybe shared native memory between java side and c++ side using a direct ByteBuffer or something else
